# SoloTotal:
## A STARsolo/Snakemake pipeline for QC, alignment, and quantification of single-cell **total** RNAseq datasets
## Uses an iterative alignment strategy to improve alignment/counting of multimappers and small RNAs

***NOTE: this is still a work-in-progress, use at your own risk!***

###TODO
- Draw out workflow
- Automate smRNAseq ref generation
- Add more species to capabilities
